LavaLab Countdown
=================

###Why
A great tradition in LavaLab is limiting our pitches to three minutes and having our audience applaud promptly at that time to ensure that our teams wrap it up.

We are using this countdown on a large screen during our events so that the audience can know when to applaud.

###Use
We've hardcoded the time into the page so that we can just click the reset button. Do a git pull and go ahead and run:)
